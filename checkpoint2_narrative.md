Our project looks at the Crash Reporting dataset which provides data on all traffic collisions occurring in roadways located within Montgomery County in the state of Maryland. In this project, we are attempting to develop a predictive model that estimates the extent of vehicle damage in all traffic incidents in order to gain a deeper understanding of traffic collision patterns and to facilitate proactive measures for risk and safety management in Montgomery County.
One stakeholder for this project is government agencies or local government representatives who would have an interest in better understanding accident patterns which could then influence resource allocation or different policy-making decisions. Another stakeholder for our project is auto insurance companies which could greatly benefit from data on the various levels of risk attached to the different levels of vehicle damage.
Thus far we have decided that the most important features in our dataset are Route Type, collision type, weather, vehicle body car, speed limit, vehicle make, and vehicle model. We will try to keep as many columns in the dataset as possible by using label encoding for our categorical variables which assigns each unique category in a categorical variable a unique integer. Because the vast majority of our columns are categorical, this will be the tool that we use for dealing with most of the dataset. 
When analyzing our dataset for missing values we decided to clean and enrich our dataset by dropping many columns that we deemed to not be necessary for our future analysis. These columns included description columns, road and cross-street names, and ID and number columns. Another process of data cleaning and preparation for the data was changing the NA values to unknown. This approach was justified because the columns already contained entries labeled as unknown. This step also prevented the unnecessary loss of data rows due to missing values. Currently our decision tree f1 score is not very high, but by the next checkpoint we will try many different models to see which one fits best with our dataset and goal.
One plan of ours is to utilize the latitudinal and longitudinal data to map out where car crashes are most likely to happen in the state of Maryland which is what our dataset covers. This map will be a choropleth map using the GeoJSON library to color the state of Maryland States based on where the car accidents are happening.
